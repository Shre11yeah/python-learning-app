# Python Learning App

# Download PyLearn from [Here!](https://github.com/vedant2608/python-learning-app/releases/tag/v1.0)

- Currently It is packaged only for windows, upload the packaged for Linux and MacOs also.

This project has been developed using Streamlit, with the aim of facilitating Python learning for newcomers to the language. 

  - Goal is to provide a comprehensive learning experience by combining theoretical lessons with practical coding exercises.

- Currently, the platform covers all major Python concepts, allowing users to practice coding directly in the web-based editor.

I am continuously working on adding new functionalities, such as support for packages, to enhance the learning experience further.

Stay tuned as I work on updates and improvements. I will also be sharing executable versions of the application, so everyone can access it conveniently.

Contributions to the project are always welcome! Whether you're a seasoned Python developer or just starting out, your input can help us make this learning platform even better. Happy learning, everyone!

### While contributing please remember the follwing
- Project structure is very easy to understand, `codefile.py` is where your code will be saved, `lessons` directory contain all the lessons, `pages` directory will be used to store the modules which you have created, the files will be dynamically created in this folder (It contains the streamlit code)
- The actual code of your modules will be in `allmodules` directory 
- Download the files and in the lsessons folder you can add your own set of lessons
- The file is converted to .exe using PyInstaller with wrapper script. Not using the script files in this repository
