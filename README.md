# Python Learning App

This project has been developed using Streamlit, with the aim of facilitating Python learning for newcomers to the language. 

- Goal is to provide a comprehensive learning experience by combining theoretical lessons with practical coding exercises.

- Currently, the platform covers all major Python concepts, allowing users to practice coding directly in the web-based editor.

I am continuously working on adding new functionalities, such as support for packages, to enhance the learning experience further.

Stay tuned as we roll out updates and improvements. We will also be sharing executable versions of the application, so everyone can access it conveniently.

Contributions to the project are always welcome! Whether you're a seasoned Python developer or just starting out, your input can help us make this learning platform even better. Happy learning, everyone!
